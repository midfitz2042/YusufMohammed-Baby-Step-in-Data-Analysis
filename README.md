# Project Objective: Problem Statement
Getting familiar with the analytics side of Microsoft Excel

-----
# Data Sourcing
I got my dataset from  https://aka.ms/30DLDATFinanceDataSample which was provided by Microsoft for learning purposes

# Data Transformation
Since I was mainly concerned with the analytics side of Microsoft Excel, I decided to explore the Analyze button from the menu bar; <br />
I inserted a Pivot Table for a range of Metrics including: Sales by Country and Product, Sales and COGS by Month name, Manufacturing price
by Date and Country; <br />
I also inserted 3 Pivot charts; <br />
I also got the chance to explore asking for insights by searching for "Chart of Units sold by Product" <br />
I was able to Filter the Values on a Pivot table to appear alphabetically and I cut and pasted the charts on the same sheet for visibility; <br />
I then renamed the worksheets for better communication <br />

# Findings and Recommendation
From this activity, I was able to understand how Microsoft Excel has evolved to make the work of Data analysts a little less hectic, and time saving. <br />
I also got to understand how powerful insights could be generated using the Analyze feature of Microsoft Excel
